# GLOSSY

Photo cards with AI-generated handwriting, personalized with your own writing style.

## Project Status

**Phase:** Model Evaluation - ✅ One-DM SUCCESS
**Date:** Jan 21, 2026
**Repository:** https://github.com/justinmvail/glossy

### Current State

✅ **Completed:**
- Repository initialized and pushed to GitHub
- SDT model fully tested with real English handwriting data (FAILED - illegible output)
- One-DM repository cloned and fully configured
- One-DM tested with IAM English dataset - **SUCCESS!**

✅ **One-DM Evaluation Results:**
- **SUCCESS:** English handwriting output is **HIGHLY LEGIBLE**
- Tested with IAM English dataset (real handwriting samples)
- Generated 5 words: all are clear, readable, production-quality
- Only requires 1 style sample (vs SDT's 15)
- **Conclusion:** One-DM is VIABLE for English handwriting

### Architecture Decision

**Server-Side Generation:**
- One-DM model is 1.6 GB (too large for on-device)
- Will run on AWS Lambda or EC2
- User submits 1 handwriting sample + message text
- Backend generates handwriting image with One-DM
- Vectorization step converts raster to AxiDraw-compatible format

### Next Steps

1. Research image vectorization (Potrace, Autotrace, custom edge detection)
2. Test One-DM with user-provided samples (not just dataset)
3. Design backend architecture for server-side generation
4. Test AxiDraw with vectorized One-DM output

## Quick Start

This repository contains the GLOSSY development workspace:

- **app/** - Flutter mobile app (not started)
- **backend/** - AWS serverless backend (not started)
- **models/SDT/** - SDT handwriting model (setup complete, evaluation in progress)
- **scripts/** - Order processing utilities (not started)
- **docs/** - Additional documentation

## Overview

GLOSSY lets users send physical photo cards with personalized handwriting on the back. The handwriting is generated by an AI model (SDT) trained on the user's own handwriting style, then pen-plotted on real cards using an AxiDraw plotter.

**Key Features:**
- Custom handwriting generation (not preset fonts)
- On-device AI processing (pending model viability)
- AWS serverless backend
- Manual fulfillment with AxiDraw pen plotter

See [GLOSSY.md](./GLOSSY.md) for full project details, technical notes, and progress log.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (for app development)
- AWS CLI (for backend deployment)
- Python 3.x (for SDT model)
