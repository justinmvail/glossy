# GLOSSY

Photo cards with AI-generated handwriting, personalized with your own writing style.

## Quick Start

This repository contains the full GLOSSY stack:

- **app/** - Flutter mobile app (iOS first)
- **backend/** - AWS serverless backend (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3)
- **models/** - SDT handwriting model integration
- **scripts/** - Order processing and utility scripts
- **docs/** - Additional documentation

## Overview

GLOSSY lets users send physical photo cards with personalized handwriting on the back. The handwriting is generated by an AI model (SDT) trained on the user's own handwriting style, then pen-plotted on real cards using an AxiDraw plotter.

**Key Features:**
- Custom handwriting generation (not preset fonts)
- On-device AI processing
- AWS serverless backend
- Manual fulfillment with pen plotter

## Project Status

**Phase:** Pre-launch - Testing SDT handwriting output
