# GLOSSY - Photo Cards with AI Handwriting

## What it is
Consumer app for sending photo cards with the user's own handwriting on the back, generated by AI and pen-plotted on real cards.

## Tech Stack

### App
- **Platform:** Flutter (iOS first)
- **AI Model:** SDT (CVPR 2023) - outputs stroke coordinates, runs quantized on-device
- **Handwriting Input:** ~15 characters on-screen → rendered to 64x64 PNGs

### Backend
- **Cloud:** AWS free tier
  - HTTP API Gateway
  - Lambda
  - DynamoDB
  - S3
  - SES (Simple Email Service)
- **Domain:** glossy.ink (Cloudflare DNS)
- **Hosting:** S3 + CloudFront
- **Address Validation:** Geocodio (75k/month free, score > 0.8)

### Fulfillment
- **Plotter:** AxiDraw (pen plotter)
- **Process:** Manual from garage

## How it Works

1. User draws ~15 characters on-screen → rendered to 64x64 PNGs
2. SDT encodes style, generates stroke coordinates for any message
3. Order sent to backend (strokes JSON + photo + address)
4. Justin pulls orders, plots on AxiDraw, mails cards

## Key Decisions

- ✅ Custom handwriting is a must-have (not preset fonts)
- ✅ Customer's address as return address (feels personal)
- ✅ "Report a Problem" button → free replacement
- ✅ Referral program:
  - 1 referral = free card
  - 5 referrals = POD shirt
  - 10 referrals = hoodie

## Kill Criteria

**Pivot to B2B if <50 paying customers in 3 months**

## Risks

- Distribution challenges
- Seasonal demand
- Price sensitivity ($5 vs free text)
- Single plotter bottleneck

## Strengths

- ~$700 startup cost
- Technical moat (SDT on-device)
- Pivot optionality to B2B

## First Priority

**Test SDT handwriting output on real people before building the full app**

## Progress Log

### ✅ Completed (Jan 21, 2026)

**SDT Model Setup:**
- Cloned SDT repository (CVPR 2023 - Style-Disentangled Transformer)
- Set up Python 3.11 environment with PyTorch 2.2.2
- Downloaded pre-trained models:
  - SDT checkpoint (261 MB)
  - Content encoder (69 MB)
- Patched code for macOS compatibility (removed CUDA dependencies)
- Model runs on Apple Silicon GPU (MPS)

**Verification:**
- Model loads successfully (67.8M parameters, ~259 MB)
- Generates stroke coordinates in correct format: `[dx, dy, pen_up, pen_down, pen_end]`
- Created test scripts for validation and visualization
- Output format confirmed compatible with AxiDraw plotter

### ⚠️ Issues Discovered

**Model Output Quality:**
- Current English model checkpoint produces illegible output
- Model appears trained primarily for Chinese/Japanese handwriting
- Synthetic font-based samples don't match model's expected input format
- Requires actual handwritten samples (pen/stylus input) vs. computer fonts

**Model Size:**
- 259 MB is too large for on-device mobile deployment
- Quantization required for iOS (target: <50 MB)
- May need to evaluate alternative approaches

### ❌ SDT Evaluation Results (Jan 21, 2026)

**Test 1: Synthetic Font Samples**
- Used computer-rendered Bradley Hand font (15 samples)
- Result: Complete garbage - random diagonal lines, illegible
- Conclusion: Model requires real pen/stylus handwriting data

**Test 2: Real CASIA English Dataset**
- Downloaded official English dataset (204 test writers, 62 characters)
- Generated 1,984 samples with real handwriting style references
- Result: **STILL ILLEGIBLE** - most characters unrecognizable
- Only ~1-2 out of 12 samples were borderline readable ('Z', maybe '7')
- Examples: 'w', '4', 'W', 'a', 'G', 'O' were messy, unrecognizable strokes

**Critical Blocker:**
- SDT does not produce legible English handwriting suitable for customer cards
- This is a **product-killing issue** - can't ship illegible handwriting
- The checkpoint may be primarily Chinese/Japanese trained
- English support appears to be poor despite claims in paper

**Decision:**
- ❌ SDT is NOT viable for GLOSSY (English handwriting)
- ✅ Moving to One-DM evaluation (ECCV 2024, claims better results with 1 sample vs 15)

### ✅ One-DM Evaluation Results (Jan 21, 2026)

**Model Setup:**
- Cloned One-DM repository (ECCV 2024 - One-Shot Diffusion Mimicker)
- Set up Python 3.11 environment with PyTorch 2.2.2
- Downloaded 3 model checkpoints (1.6 GB total):
  - One-DM-ckpt.pt (1.2 GB)
  - vae_HTR138.pth (337 MB)
  - RN18_class_10400.pth (63 MB)
- Downloaded IAM English dataset with text corpus files
- Created macOS-compatible test script (removed CUDA multi-GPU dependencies)
- Model runs on Apple Silicon GPU (MPS)

**Test: IAM English Dataset**
- Generated 5 sample words: 'accents', 'fifty', 'gross', 'Tea', 'whom'
- Used DDIM sampling with 50 timesteps
- Generation time: ~2-3 seconds per timestep, ~12 minutes total for 5 samples
- Output: Raster images (64x height pixels, grayscale PNG)

**Results: FAILED ❌**
- **CRITICAL ISSUE: Character accuracy problems**
- Word "Tea" consistently rendered with wrong letters:
  - Expected: "Tea"
  - Generated: "alea", "atea", "ales", etc. (checked 10+ samples from different writers)
- Output is MORE legible than SDT (recognizable glyphs)
- BUT characters are WRONG - this is a product-killing issue

**Investigation Findings:**
- Created debug scripts to verify content encoder input
- Confirmed input glyphs are CORRECT: 'T' (idx 33), 'e' (idx 8), 'a' (idx 19)
- Verified with debug_content_v2.py - input visualization shows proper "Tea" glyphs
- Problem is in MODEL OUTPUT, not preprocessing
- Model systematically hallucinates/substitutes wrong characters
- This is a fundamental model accuracy issue

**Key Findings:**
- One-DM produces more legible output than SDT (actual letter shapes vs random strokes)
- Only requires 1 style sample (vs SDT's 15)
- Generates raster images instead of stroke coordinates
- Would need vectorization post-processing for AxiDraw plotter
- Model size: ~1.6 GB (server-side generation only)
- **BUT: Character accuracy makes it unusable for customer photo cards**

**Decision:**
- ❌ **One-DM is NOT VIABLE for GLOSSY**
- Character errors are unacceptable for personalized messages
- Cannot ship cards that say wrong words to customers

### 🔄 One-DM Training Attempt (Jan 22, 2026)

**Goal:** Re-train One-DM from scratch to see if custom training improves character accuracy.

**Hardware:** NVIDIA GTX 1660 Super (6GB VRAM)

#### Initial Attempt (batch_size=2, no AMP)

**Changes for 1660 Super (low VRAM):**
- Created `configs/IAM64_small.yml` with memory-optimized settings:
  - `SOLVER.TYPE: SGD` (instead of AdamW - lower memory footprint)
  - `TRAIN.IMS_PER_BATCH: 2` (small batch size)
  - `SOLVER.GRAD_L2_CLIP: 1.0` (gradient clipping)
  - `SOLVER.WARMUP_ITERS: 5000`
  - `DATA_LOADER.NUM_THREADS: 2`
- Changed `SNAPSHOT_BEGIN: 1` and `SNAPSHOT_ITERS: 1` (save checkpoint after each epoch)
- Training uses single GPU via `torchrun --nproc_per_node=1`

**Problem Discovered:** Small batch size (2) weakens NCE contrastive learning.
- One-DM authors use 4 GPUs × batch_size=2 = effective batch_size=8
- NCE loss requires negative pairs within each batch to learn writer style differentiation
- With batch_size=2, often only 0-1 negative pairs available → weak style encoder training
- Reconstruction loss (main quality metric) unaffected, but style fidelity may suffer

#### Optimization Attempts (Jan 22, 2026)

**Goal:** Increase batch size to improve NCE contrastive learning.

**Approaches Tested:**

| Approach | Result | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| AMP (Mixed Precision) | ❌ Failed | NaN errors in UNet attention layers |
| batch_size=4 + AdamW | ❌ OOM | Needs ~6.5GB |
| batch_size=2 + AdamW | ❌ OOM | Needs ~5.8GB |
| batch_size=2 + SGD | ✅ Works | Uses ~5.0GB |

**AMP Investigation:**
- Created `trainer/trainer_amp.py` with GradScaler and autocast
- Tested various configurations (FP32 VAE encode, FP32 loss computation)
- Model produces NaN in UNet attention layers regardless of configuration
- Conclusion: One-DM's attention architecture is not AMP-compatible

**Memory Constraints:**
- GTX 1660 Super: 6GB VRAM
- One-DM with batch_size=2 + SGD: ~5.0GB (87% utilization)
- AdamW requires ~2x optimizer memory vs SGD (momentum + variance)
- No headroom for larger batches without AMP

**Final Working Config (`configs/IAM64_small.yml`):**
```yaml
SOLVER:
  BASE_LR: 0.0001
  EPOCHS: 100
  WARMUP_ITERS: 5000
  TYPE: SGD
  GRAD_L2_CLIP: 1.0
TRAIN:
  IMS_PER_BATCH: 2
```

**Training Command:**
```bash
cd /home/server/One-DM
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 \
    -- train.py --cfg configs/IAM64_small.yml --log sgd_100ep
```

**Impact:**
- Reconstruction loss: Unaffected (trains normally)
- NCE contrastive loss: Weak signal (only 0-1 negative pairs per batch)
- Expected result: Legible handwriting, potentially weaker style matching

**Location:** `/home/server/One-DM/`

**Status:** ~~Training in progress~~ Single epoch completed - see results below.

### 📊 Single Epoch Training Results (Jan 23, 2026)

**Training Completed:**
- Epochs: 1/1 (23,310 iterations)
- Duration: ~2 hours
- Final MSE loss: ~0.02
- Checkpoint saved: `Saved/IAM64_small/epoch1_v2-20260122_215439/model/0-ckpt.pt` (1.2 GB)

**Test Generation:**
- Generated test words: "hello", "the", "quick", "fox"
- Sampling: DDIM with 50 timesteps
- Output: 64px height grayscale images

**Results: Model Undertrained ⚠️**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Image generation | ✅ Works - produces grayscale output |
| Correct dimensions | ✅ Works - width scales with word length |
| Stroke-like patterns | ✅ Partial - some dark shapes visible |
| Legible handwriting | ❌ Failed - abstract blobs, no letters |

**Sample Outputs (1 epoch):**
- All words produce abstract gray/white blob patterns
- No recognizable letter shapes
- Model has learned basic image structure but not character formation

**Conclusion:**
- 1 epoch is insufficient for diffusion model convergence
- Need 50-100+ epochs for legible handwriting output
- GTX 1660 Super (6GB) is too slow (~2 hours/epoch = 100-200 hours total)
- **Cloud GPU training required for practical iteration**

### 🔄 Next Steps

**Completed Evaluations:**
1. ~~Test SDT with real English data~~ ✅ Done - ❌ FAILED (illegible output)
2. ~~Evaluate One-DM (newer model, ECCV 2024)~~ ✅ Done - ❌ FAILED (wrong characters)
3. ~~Research open-source handwriting AI models~~ ✅ Done - 17 models identified

**Current Situation:**
- **Both major models failed quality tests**
- SDT: Completely illegible (random strokes)
- One-DM: Legible but wrong characters ("Tea" → "alea")
- No single open-source model has: vector output + few-shot + high accuracy

**Options to Consider:**

1. **Test other models from research:**
   - DiffusionPen (AAAI 2024) - diffusion model with writer-aware features
   - FW-GAN (2022) - GAN-based with writer-conditioned generation
   - DiffBrush (2023) - diffusion with stroke-level control
   - Note: Most modern models output raster images, require vectorization

2. **Hybrid approach:**
   - Use raster-based model (if one has better accuracy than One-DM)
   - Add InkSight vectorization to convert images → SVG strokes
   - Concern: Doesn't solve One-DM's character accuracy problem

3. **Traditional approach (no few-shot):**
   - handwriting-synthesis (Graves 2013) - direct vector output
   - Requires retraining per user (~2-3 hours GPU per person)
   - Removes "personalized style" selling point or adds cost/latency

4. **Non-AI alternatives:**
   - Font-based with handwriting-style fonts
   - Manual tracing of user handwriting samples
   - Partner with existing handwriting API services

**Priority: Determine viability before building infrastructure**

### 📊 Handwriting AI Models Research (Jan 21, 2026)

**Criteria:**
- Open-source/free
- Few-shot capable (1-20 samples without retraining)
- Vector/stroke output OR high-quality raster
- English handwriting support

**17 Models Identified:**

| Model | Year | Output | Few-shot | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|----------|--------|-------|
| **SDT** | 2023 | Strokes | ❌ (needs 15) | ❌ FAILED | Illegible English output |
| **One-DM** | 2024 | Raster | ✅ (1 sample) | ❌ FAILED | Wrong characters ("Tea"→"alea") |
| **DiffusionPen** | 2024 | Raster | ✅ (few-shot) | Not tested | SOTA quality claimed |
| **InkSight** | 2024 | Strokes | ❌ | Not tested | Vectorization tool, not generator |
| **DiffBrush** | 2023 | Raster | ✅ | Not tested | Stroke-level control |
| **Diff-Handwriting** | 2023 | Raster | ✅ | Not tested | Diffusion-based |
| **FW-GAN** | 2022 | Raster | ✅ | Not tested | GAN-based |
| **GANwriting** | 2020 | Raster | ✅ | Not tested | GAN-based |
| **HWT** | 2022 | Raster | ❌ (paired) | Not tested | Paired style transfer |
| **SmartPatch** | 2023 | Raster | ❌ | Not tested | Patch-based |
| **handwriting-synthesis** | 2013 | Strokes | ❌ (retrain) | Not tested | Graves RNN, direct vector |
| **DeepWriting** | 2016 | Strokes | ❌ (retrain) | Not tested | Extended Graves model |
| **Handwriting Transformer** | 2021 | Strokes | ❌ (retrain) | Not tested | Transformer-based |
| **Text-to-Handwriting** | 2020 | Raster | ❌ | Not tested | Pix2pix GAN |
| **VATr** | 2021 | Raster | ❌ | Not tested | Vision-audio transformer |
| **Write Like Me** | 2021 | Raster | ❌ | Not tested | Commercial API reference |
| **CalliGAN** | 2020 | Raster | ❌ | Not tested | Calligraphy-focused |

**Key Insights:**
- **Modern models** (2023-2024): Diffusion-based, raster output, best quality, few-shot capable
- **Classic models** (2013-2016): RNN-based, stroke output, require full retraining
- **No perfect match**: No open-source model has vector + few-shot + proven accuracy
- **Hybrid approach needed**: Best modern model + vectorization tool (InkSight)

**Concern:** One-DM (the most recent diffusion model) already failed accuracy tests. Other diffusion models may have similar issues.
